Homework assignment problem
Imagine a scenario where three employees are tasked with combing
through a shelf full of books to find specific information. To ensure
the work is divided both fairly and efficiently, the books need to

be allocated among the three without the hassle of moving them
around or creating separate piles. The simplest solution is to split
the shelf into three distinct sections, with each section assigned to
one employee.
But how can we ensure the division is equitable? If every book
were the same size, the solution would be straightforward: divide the
shelf into equal sections, like so:
100 100 100 – 100 100 100 – 100 100 100
This way, each person faces 300 pages.
However, the challenge arises when books vary in size. Using the
same method for a shelf with books of the following sizes:

100 200 300 – 400 500 600 – 700 800 900, it’s clear that the distri-
bution is uneven. The first section has a total of 600 pages, whereas

the last one contains a whopping 2,400 pages. In such cases, I’d
definitely prefer the first section!
To achieve a more balanced workload, a better division might look
something like this:
100 200 300 400 500 – 600 700 – 800 900
In this arrangement, the heaviest load a person would have is 1,700
pages, and the lightest is 1,300 pages. This example illustrates the
need for a strategic approach to distribute workloads as evenly as
possible when dealing with tasks of varying difficulty or size.
